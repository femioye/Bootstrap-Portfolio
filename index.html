                        <p>My name is Oluwafemi Oyedeji. I was born in Lagos, Southwestern part of Nigeria. I graduated with
                            a degree in electrical engineering from Poma International Business University, Benin. Right
                            from the time I was a teenager, I played with computers a lot as my hobby, my passion, and my
                            way of learning. Like most kids I enjoyed computer games. When my uncle gave me a computer as
                            a reward for making honor roll in my fourth year at high school, I mastered DOS, Windows, and
                            WordPerfect within six months. I then went on to teach myself programming basics.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Also, in my second year at college I took two programming classes in which I had an Aâ€™s. From then
                            I developed a lot of interest in computer science and which to develop my career in that direction.
                            I am currently enrolled at the boot camp coding program at the University of Minnesota to enable
                            me achieving my dream of becoming a professional software engineer where I will have the opportunity
                            to qualify for numerous computing jobs. At the completion of this program, I would have acquired
                            the necessary technical know-how needed to build my own web and mobile applications which is
                            my ultimate goal.
